				<h1>Pricing statuses in AMPT</h1>
				<br />
				<p><b>PRE-APPROVED RATES: </b>A line item with an offered rate that is
					equal to the corresponding list rate or an applicable category rate
					is marked as "System Approved."</p>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>List rates may have changed
					slightly (based on new calculation of section weights) between the
					time the rate card rate was last checked at the line item level and
					the time it is recalculated as part of a revision.</li>
						<li>To mitigate
					slight variations in rates, the system rules will build in a slight
					% variation ("tolerance") between offered rate and rate card rate
					that is acceptable in terms of granting "system approval". AMPT is
					currently considering 5% as the max tolerance limit.</li>
						<li>Line items
					from packages with pre-defined rates are also "System Approved".
					However once package line is copied to a proposal, any further
					changes on that line should lead to the status of that line being
					evaluated again. During bulk update of rate card, system will check
					if rate card price for package line item has changed or not, if
					yes, then the status will be evaluated again. </li>
					<li>A line item with
					an offered rate that is below list or category rate but is for an
					advertiser that has been flagged as having an external rate
					contract is marked as " System Approved".
						<ul>
							<li>External ratecard/contract" flag is managed at an advertiser or category level</li>
							<li>Expiration dates for these flags can be set</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="clearboth"></div>
					</li>
					<li>Line items with Flat Rate as type are automatically "System Approved".</li>
					</ol> 
					<p><b>UNAPPROVED: </b>A line item with an offered rate that is below rate card rate which
					exceeds the tolerance limit defined (currently at 5%) and is for an
					advertiser without an external rate contract is marked as
					"Unapproved."</p>
					<p><b>PRICING MANAGER APPROVED: </b>A planner can move forward
					and backward in the Proposal workflow but system will throw a
					warning if any line item in that plan is unapproved. Any plan with
					unapproved line items should be sent for the Pricing Review unless
					there is an emergency. System's role will be only to display
					warning for unapproved lines when they move forward or backward in
					the workflow. When Pricing Manager reviews a plan, they can make
					changes to any line and change the offered CPM. The crucial point
					is that when they submit the proposal back to planning team, there
					will be a pop-up coming up in front of them where they are expected
					to choose the options they have reviewed and against each chosen
					Option, they need to specify the minimum threshold value under
					which all "Pricing Approved" need to be checked again for
					thresholds. System will calculate the total value of qualifying
					lines in each option (which excludes the Added Value and Flat Rate
					and Pre-emptible lines) and then deduct this value by a standard
					defined percentage which is 10% and suggest the same in the popup.
					Pricing Managers can obviously over-ride the suggested value and
					define their own threshold value but that value cannot be more than
					the total value of the qualifying lines for that option.</p>
					<p>To explain it further, suppose pricing manager goes through all unapproved
					lines and decides to change their CPM or create new lines.
					Once they submit the plan back to the planning team, all the unapproved
					lines (after all Pricing Manager changes) become "Pricing Approved"
					automatically but at the same time Pricing Manager will provide a
					condition where they will explicitly tell what should be the
					minimum value for each plan option below which the "Pricing
					Approved" lines will again become Unapproved or System Approved
					based on the discount offered in those lines. Added Value lines
					will also get Pricing Approval Status once Pricing Manage submits
					the plan back to planning. However if any new Added Value line gets
					added at a later stage, then system will check its
					approval/rejection through normal added value rules. The pricing
					approved added-value lines will only be evaluated if the value of
					the option falls below threshold.</p>
					<p>When Pricing Manager will submit
					Proposal back to planning team, planner can change it in whatever
					way they want BUT whatever lines which are marked as Pricing
					Approved will be read only for all other roles including Admins.
					This means that whenever planner will work on a Pricing Approved
					line, they cannot change anything on the UI except the start date,
					end date and impressions. Once planner is done with all the
					changes, they can submit to pricing again or move it further in the
					workflow. While moving forward or backward in the workflow, system
					will check if a plan option value of the qualifying lines (which
					excludes the Added Value and Flat Rate and Pre-emptible lines) is
					less than what was given as minimum threshold by the Pricing
					Manager. If overall value comes less, then all Pricing Approved
					lines will be re-evaluated again to decide whether they are system
					approved or un-approved. Bulk update of pricing overall should also
					refresh the base price of a pricing approved line. However that
					refresh should not affect the Pricing Approval status which will be
					only evaluated when the total worth of qualifying lines goes below
					the minimum threshold set by the Pricing Manager during the last
					pricing review.</p>

				<h1 style="margin-top:10px;">Pricing Status evaluation during different events in AMPT</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>All the pricing status obviously becomes null and void if
						the sales category or the advertiser of the proposal is changed
						and everything is evaluated again.</li>
					<li>Line item with no rate card price is considered as
						Unapproved by default.</li>
					<li>If a plan option is revised, pricing status in all the
						line items will be copied from the original version to the new
						version.</li>
					<li>If a line item is cloned within a plan option, the status
						of the cloned line is calculated in a fresh way.</li>
					<li>If a proposal is cloned, pricing status of all the lines
						will be re-evaluated again. The rate card will also be refreshed
						for the cloned lines but the CPM will stay same.</li>
					<li>If a reservation is moved between Proposals, the rate card
						price as well as pricing status in the copied line will be
						refreshed again as per the target proposal. The CPM will stay
						same.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Added Value Rules</h1>
				<p>A new screen has been added for the Administrators to setup
					the Value Add thresholds allowed depending upon the total value of
					the plan. Administrator are able to set up a rule that determines
					the max $ amount of "Added Value" that can be "pre-approved" for a
					plan option.For each rule, the administrator can define:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The % of the total qualifying spend that can be offered as
						added value</li>
					<li>The amount of the qualifying spend (i.e., for a plan that
						includes at least $50K of placements that qualify, added-value
						worth 5% of the total value of the qualifying placements can be
						included)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The administrator can create rules for successively higher
					threshold qualifying spends (e.g. for $50K, for $100K, for $150K,
					for $500K, etc.) So they will have simple screen to configure the
					data like:-</p>
				<table style="margin-left: 6px;">
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<td>Added Value Percentage Allowed</td>
							<td>Plan Budget</td>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>5%</td>
							<td>50,000</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>8%</td>
							<td>80,000</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<p>
					The trickiest aspect of this is that once the total value of the
					pre-approved amount of added value has been calculated, AMPT must
					reduce that amount by the total value of discounts applied to any
					qualifying lines. Here is how this works:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A plan has $50K of qualifying spend (spend without
							pre-emptible and flat rates), and the administrator has set up 5%
							pre-approved added value for such plans. This means that AT MOST,
							the planner can offer added value worth $2,500.</li>
						<li>All lines in the plan are offered at rate card EXCEPT
							ONE.</li>
						<li>The line that is offered at a discount is one of the
							qualifying lines.</li>
						<li>The rate card for this line is $30. The planner has
							offered 40K impressions at $25, however, so the value of the
							discount on that line is $200. This is arrived at by subtracting
							the actual value of the line (25*40000/1000 = $1,000) from the
							rate card value of the line (30*40000/1000 = $1,200).</li>
						<li>Because one of the qualifying lines includes a $200
							savings for the client, the total pre-approved amount of AV must
							be reduced by $200 to $2,300.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					Note that if any line item has CPM more than the rate card price,
					then that will not affect the Added Value worth. This means that
					Added Value worth will only focus on discounts offered and not on
					any line item which has CPM higher than the Rate Card. Once a
					dollar value for the amount of pre-approved added value has been
					calculated for a specific plan option, AMPT will help the planner
					determine how many impressions can be offered in the added-value
					line item. This is accomplished by providing an icon next to
					Offered Impression field on the line item screen where system will
					suggest how many impressions can be offered based on the total
					added value rules applicable. This value will be calculated based
					on how much added value can be offered in the plan*1000/rate card.
					The Added Value rules will be based on the entire plan option and
					will be calculated whenever user saves a line. If the added value
					rules get violated overall, all the added-value lines will
					forcefully become "Unapproved".
